# Calculator
### Built with React + Redux

You should probably be doing this in your head...

Demo: [http://codepen.io/nateinaction/full/vyQoVP/](http://codepen.io/nateinaction/full/vyQoVP/)

### Features
- User can customize pomodoro and break length
- When counter hits 0, a bell rings and the next timer is started
- Mobile friendly

### Possible Upgrades
- Use timestamps instead of integer based counter so clock will "continue" when client sleeps
- Cross device sign-in with firebase
- Track completed pomodoros and display with Chart.js

This Pomodoro Clock was built to complete the [challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-javascript-calculator) on Free Code Camp.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
